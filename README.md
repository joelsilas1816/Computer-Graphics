â€¢	It can be used in  a  range  of  graphics  applications, such as games, CAD design, or modeling. OpenGL API is designed mostly in hardware so it is a hardware logic.

## ðŸ“ŒProjects implemented in Computer Graphics :
1. Car Locomotion (using the graphics library in C++)
2. Depiction of sunrise and sunset using OpenGL
